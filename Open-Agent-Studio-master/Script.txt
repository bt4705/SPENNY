Hello and welcome to cheat layer

This is a quick overview of how to schedule automation in the new cheat layer UI 
 
 The new dashboard streams lens the process to be much easier 
 
 All you have to do is select the automation that you want to automate and schedule from the right-hand side 
 
 then click this “schedule” button 
 
 you can either schedule things to the extension which has no limit

you can schedule as many times as you want 
 
 Or you can schedule tasks to Cheat Cloud, which allows you to scale up tasks to thousands of operations 

 the new scheduling system uses our fault tolerance scheduling server for both the local extension and Cheat Cloud 
 
 And it uses extension webhooks for local extension scheduling, which means if your browser is closed and you scheduled something to run at 9 am every day, it'll queue the tasks to run them again when you open them again or when you open the browser again 
 
 so this allows you if you're late, to catch up on work which is very useful for productivity 
 
 But you now also have the option to fall back to cheat cloud if it's very urgent work or time-sensitive
 
 both of these now use our chrome scheduling format which allows you to schedule months in advance down to the minute 
 
 Which allows you to create any sort of schedule you want with any sort of granularity 

 I am just going to do a quick example here if you wanted to do schedule every minute task, all you need to do is to select all the stars here
 
 Once done, Click this “submit” button to submit your schedule  

You can click the scheduled automations in the list to see their logs after running.
